/*

enforce_for_root

minlen=10 ➤ The minimun characters a password must contain.

ucredit=-1 ➤ The password at least have to contain a capital letter. We must write it with a - sign, as is how it knows that's refering to minumum caracters; if we put a + sign it will refer to maximum characters.

dcredit=-1 ➤ The passworld at least have to containt a digit.

lcredit=-1 ➤ The password at least have to contain a lowercase letter.

maxrepeat=3 ➤ The password can not have the same character repited three contiusly times.

reject_username ➤ The password can not contain the username inside itself.

difok=7 ➤ The password it have to containt at least seven diferent characters from the last password ussed.

enforce_for_root ➤ We will implement this password policy to root.

once opened the port we can connect with: ssh <user>@localhost -p 4242 -> connect the virtual machine with 4242 port open

writing a script to see all it's going on in the machine
/*
uname -a -> all machine info, exept the cpu if it is unknown 
grep "physical id" /proc/cpuinfo | wc -l -> 'grep' looks insede the /proc folder, the 'cpuinfo' file and search for the 'physical id' to show the number of physical cores. the wc -l flag return the lines of the grep output
grep processor /proc/cpuinfo | wc -l -> as before, 'grep' the 'virtual' core of the processor
awk -> acts like a filter to select which thing we want to see
free -> show the 'RAM' memory. with 'awk' we can see the used memory
free --mega | awk '$1 == "Mem:" {print $3}' -> compare if the first word of a row is equal to "Mem:" we will print the third word of that row, which will be the used memory
free --mega | awk '$1 == "Mem:" {print $2}' -> obtai the total memory
free --mega | awk '$1 == "Mem:" {printf("(%.2f%%)\n", $3/$2*100)}' -> calculate the '%' used memory ('%.2f' gives only 2 decimal, '%%' is to show a '%' ofc, the last is the % fromula)
df -> show the occupied and aviable memory of the disk ('df' is 'disk filesystem')
df -m | grep "/dev/" | grep -v "/boot" | awk '{memory_use += $3} END {print memory_use}' -> ('-m' is to see the size in megabyte, 'grep' to search in /dev/, 'grep -v' to exclude linse that contain /boot, 'awk' to see the used space and '+' to sum. we sum the third words of each line)
df -m | grep "/dev/" | grep -v "/boot" | awk '{memory_result += $2} END {printf("%.0fGb\n"), memory_result/1024}' -> obtain the total space ('$2') in Gb ('/1024') with no float ('%.0f).
df -m | grep "/dev/" | grep -v "/boot" | awk '{use += $3} {total += $2} END {printf("(%d%%)\n"), use/total*100}' -> show % of the used memory
vmstat -> show system statistics
vmstat 1 4 | tail -1 | awk '{print $15}' -> in an interval from '1' to '4' sec, show only the last line (tail -1) and only the 15th word ('awk {print $15}')
who -> to see the date and time o four last restart. ('-b') To see the time of the last system boot on screen
who -b | awk '$1 == "system" {print $3 " " $4}' -> to only show the date and time of last system reboot
lsblk -> show us all info about all block device (hard drive, SSDs, memories, etc...)
if [ $(lsblk | grep "lvm" | wc -l) -gt 0 ]; then echo yes; else echo no; fi -> command print yes id LVMGroup is present on system block device, no otherwise
ss -> To check the number of established TCP connections
ss -ta | grep ESTAB | wc -l -> ('-ta') chek only TCP connections, ('grep' only ESTAB), and ('wc -l') print line
users -> show all users
users | wc -w -> count the number of words
hostname -I -> show the host address
ip link -> obtain all info of the network interface
ip link | grep "link/ether" | awk '{print $2}' -> show only the MAC
journalctl -> obtain the command executed with sudo. We filter the search using '_COMM=sudo' to see only sudo log.
journalctl _COMM=sudo | grep COMMAND | wc -l -> obtain only the number of sudo commands
*/

sudo crontab -u root -e -> making the script run every 'x' time per day/hour/minute/sec

// Bonus part
sudo apt install lighttpd -> installing a fast and secure webserver
sudo apt install wget zip -> install zip packages using wget to download from URL, http, https, ftp protocol
sudo wget https://it.wordpress.org/latest-it_IT.zip -> download the latest version of wordpress
sudo unzip latest-it_IT.zip -> unzip the files
sudo mv html/ html_old -> renaming html folder
sudo mv wordpress/ html -> renaming wordpress to html
sudo chmod -R 755 html -> setting the permission for html and all inner folder/files (-R, recursive). '7' is for owner's 'read' 'write' and 'execute' permissions, '5' is for user's 'read' and 'execute' permissions.
sudo apt install mariadb-server -> installing mariadb server database
sudo mysql_secure_installation -> change access to be more secure
/*
Switch to unix_socket autentication? → N
Change the root password? → N
Remove anonymous users? → Y
Disallow root login remotely? → Y
Remove test database and acces to it? → Y
Reaload privilege tables now? → Y

Switch to unix_socket authentication? We choose N because we don't want it to switch to Unix socket authentication because we already have a protected root account.

Change the root password? We choose N. We do not want to change the root password. By default we have no password but in mariadb he is not really root as we must give him administrator permissions.

Remove anonymous users? We choose Y. By default when you install mariadb it has an anonymous user, which allows anyone to log into mariadb without having to create their own user account. This is designed for testing purposes and to make the installation smoother. When we leave the development environment and want to move to a production environment we must remove the anonymous users.

Disallow root login remotely? Choose Y. Disabling root login remotely will prevent anyone from guessing the root password. We will only be able to connect to root from localhost.

Remove test database and access to it? Choose Y. This will remove the test database and any users who have access to it.

Reaload privilege tables now? Choose Y. This will reload the MySQL permission tables so that the changes to the security settings will take effect immediately.
